# Dash Application for [Job Interview Case]

## Introduction
This Dash application was initially created as part of a job interview case to showcase my ability to build interactive data visualizations. While I didn't secure the role, the project has garnered interest on GitHub as a source of inspiration for others. This README is aimed at guiding potential users on how to use and benefit from the application.
